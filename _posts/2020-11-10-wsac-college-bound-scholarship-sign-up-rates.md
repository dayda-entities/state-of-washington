The College Bound Scholarship was created to provide state financial aid to low-income students who may not consider college a possibility due to the cost. The scholarship covers tuition (at comparable public college rates), some fees, and a small book allowance.

This dataset contains the counts of 7th or 8th grade students whose family meets the income requirements (CBS_Eligible),  those who submit and complete an application by June 30 of the studentâ€™s 8th grade year(CBS_Applications), and the Sign-Up Rate (CBS_Rate) calculated as a percentage.
