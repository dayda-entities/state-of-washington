This dataset contains all jurisdictions for which at least one candidate has registered with the PDC or declared their candidacy. Jurisdictions that do not have a campaign finance filing requirement are not displayed. For example, the office of the governor is displayed only for years where the office is up for election. The dataset covers the last 10 years.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
