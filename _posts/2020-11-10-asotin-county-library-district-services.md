This dataset reports various service measures for the Asotin County (WA) Library District. These include visits to the library, computer and internet access, and circulation of various materials. The library district reports the figures annually to the Public Libraries Survey, administered by the Washington State Library in cooperation with the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services. For a detailed glossary of terms and more information about the survey, visit the Statistics page at the Washington State Library: https://www.sos.wa.gov/library/libraries/libdev/publications.aspx#WAStats
