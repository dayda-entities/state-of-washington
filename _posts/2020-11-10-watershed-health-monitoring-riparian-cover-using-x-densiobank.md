This is a list of random sites sampled by the Department of Ecology's Watershed Health Monitoring Program during 2009-2016. It includes data for riparian cover as measured with a densiometer at the bankfull margins and the amount of stream network represented by the random site. Densiometer data are assigned ratings of riparian condition relative to reference conditions.
