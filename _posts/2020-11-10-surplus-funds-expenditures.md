This dataset contains expenditures made by from surplus funds accounts of Washington State Candidates for the last 10 years as reported to the PDC on forms C3, C4, Schedule C and their electronic filing equivalents.

A surplus funds account uses the same value for the filer id field in the data set except the surplus account has a "*" in it. This can be used to correlate to the same candidate in other data sets.

For surplus accounts, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily the year the expenditure was reported.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
