This dataset only contains records for reporting years 2015 and prior. In 2016, the PDC implemented a new system for managing lobbyist reports and electronic filing. The layout of these records is incompatible with the 2016 and later record layout. Please refer to the "Lobbyist Compensation and Expenses by Source" dataset for 2016 and later records.

This dataset contains compensation and expense summary records from the monthly reports of lobbying activity. One record is included for each client that paid compensation or incurred expenses during the filing period. If the lobbyist firm themselves incurred any expenses not reimbursed by a client, a record is included summarizing the lobbyist firm's expenses. If a lobbyist reported no compensation or expenses on the report, no records will be in this dataset. Records are included for the period from 10 years prior to the current date to the end of 2015. The date is determined as the filing period of the report, not the date received. Records are included for the full year so for example, all 2007 records will be included until the entire year 2007 falls outside the 10 year time span.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
