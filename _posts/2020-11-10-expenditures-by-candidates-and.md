This dataset contains expenditures made by Washington State Candidates and Political Committees for the last 10 years as reported to the PDC on forms C3, C4, Schedule C and their electronic filing equivalents.

In-kind contributions are included in this data set as they are considered as both a contribution and expenditure. In-kind contributions are also included in the data set "Contributions to Candidates and Political Committees"

For candidates, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily the year the expenditure was reported. For political committees, the number of years is determined by the calendar year of the reporting period.

Candidates and political committees choosing to file under "mini reporting" are not included in this dataset. See WAC 390-16-105 for information regarding eligibility.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
