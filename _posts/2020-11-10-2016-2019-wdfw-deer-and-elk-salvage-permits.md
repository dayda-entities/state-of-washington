Starting July 2016, Washington deer and elk may be salvaged for use if applicant successfully obtains permit from WDFW.  This dataset will show the user when and where subject deer and elk were located pursuant to applicant's information.  To leverage this dataset to its fullest, use the mapping visualization tools to see salvage location.  Data will be updated twice per year.
