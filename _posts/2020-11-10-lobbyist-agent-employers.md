This dataset contains information about the agents employed by a lobbying firm and the employers they ultimately lobby for.

A lobbyist/firm registers with the PDC, not individual agents (employees) of that firm. The PDC provides this data as a way to see the individuals that lobby for a firm and all the employers of that firm. This does not indicate that a particular agent necessarily lobbied for a particular employer, merely that the agent's firm lobbied for that employer.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
