This dataset contains a list of all campaign finance reports (C3 and C4) for the last 10 years including attached schedules. It includes reports that have been superseded by an amendment. 

The primary purpose of this dataset is for data consumers to track report amendments and to examine the reporting history for a filer. Refer to other datasets to get actual values for any of the reports referenced herewith.

For candidates, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily the year the report was filed. For political committees, the number of years is determined by the calendar year of the reporting period.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.

CONDITION OF RELEASE: This publication and or referenced documents constitutes a list of individuals prepared by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission and may not be used for commercial purposes. This list is provided on the condition and with the understanding that the persons receiving it agree to this statutorily imposed limitation on its use. See RCW 42.56.070(9) and AGO 1975 No. 15.
