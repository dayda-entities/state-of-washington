The Washington State Department of Health presents this information as a service to the public. This includes information on the work status, practice characteristics, education, and demographics of healthcare providers, provided in response to the Washington Health Workforce Survey. 
 
This is a complete set of data across all of the responding professions. The data dictionary identifies questions that are specific to an individual profession and aren't common to all surveys. The dataset is provided without identifying information for the responding providers.
