This dataset contains a list of all pledges reported on the C4 report for the last 10 years. The dataset presents a historical perspective of pledges made by a contributor. A committee is required to report pledges of $100 or more received but not yet paid on each C4 submitted.  However, there is no correlation between the pledges reported and pledge redemption or pledge forgiveness.

Candidates and political committees choosing to file under "mini reporting" are not included in this dataset. See WAC 390-16-105 for information regarding eligibility.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information political finance disclosure requirements.
