This dataset lists Washington State public library locations that offer wireless internet access (wifi) just outside the building or facility. This external wifi access became more important during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, when public library buildings were temporarily closed. The information is based on Washington State Library surveys, correspondence with public library staff, and review of public library websites.
