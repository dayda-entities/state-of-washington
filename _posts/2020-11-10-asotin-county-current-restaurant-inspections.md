Asotin County Health Department inspects restaurants and other retail food service establishments to make sure that employees follow safe food handling practices and have adequate kitchen facilities. Keep in mind, inspection reports are snapshots of the food handling at the establishment at the time of inspection - conditions may be different when you visit.
