This file lists random sites sampled by the Department of Ecology's Watershed Health Monitoring program during 2009-2016. The list is limited to those sites known to be occupied by salmon or trout at some time during the year. It also shows percentage of the stream network represented by the site and whether the observed sediment on the surface of the stream bottom exceeded levels estimated to be optimum for sediment-sensitive salmonids.
