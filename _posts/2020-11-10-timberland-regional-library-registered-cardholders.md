This dataset reports on the number of registered cardholders in the Timberland Regional Library District, a five-county rural library district serving Thurston, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Grays Harbor counties. It includes a count of cardholders with activity in the previous 3 years, by each library location, card profile type, and year of last activity. Card profiles set library privileges for loan periods, limits on the number of items borrowed or requested, and access to digital materials, public computers, and other library resources.
