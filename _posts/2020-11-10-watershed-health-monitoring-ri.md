This dataset lists random sites sampled by Watershed Health Monitoring surveys during 2009 to 2016. It provides adjusted spatial weights (km of stream represented by the site). It also provides metric values for proximity-weighted presence of riparian disturbance from any type (PWP all) and the disturbance condition rating (low, medium, or high).  Sites are assigned regional and survey year membership.
