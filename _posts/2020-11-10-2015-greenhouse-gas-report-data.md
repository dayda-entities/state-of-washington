The map contains greenhouse gas (GHG) data reported to Ecology as of April 24, 2017. The reported emissions are preliminary and have not been fully verified by Ecology. This information is subject to change. 

Except where noted, emissions are reported in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). CO2e is a useful measure for comparing the emissions from various greenhouse gases based upon their global warming potentials.

Organizations that have emissions spread throughout the state instead of at a single location, such as petroleum product producers/importers and natural gas distributors, are not included in this map. See the complete report to view emissions for all Washington organizations that emit at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
