Percentage of direct from high school students who enrolled in Math and English courses in a given academic year and completed college-level Math and English courses within the first two consecutive academic years.  Because this metric calculates success based on completion of Math or English courses within two academic years, more recent academic years will not have data.  The Evergreen State College is not included due to nature of courses.
