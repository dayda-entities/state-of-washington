This dataset contains records indicating the employment of lobbyist firms by entities that employ lobbyists. Each record represents a registration by the lobbyist firm and employer (client) for one year. 

In some cases, the lobbyist firm may have been hired as a subcontractor by another firm to lobby on behalf of their clients. In these cases, refer to the contractor fields to determine the lobbyist firm that has hired the subcontractor.

This data set contains only records for 2016 and later. For records prior to 2016, please see the data set, "Pre-2016 Lobbyist Employment Registrations"

Each record provides links to document providing detailed information about the lobbyist firm, employer and nature of the employment.

This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.

Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information regarding political finance disclosure requirements.
