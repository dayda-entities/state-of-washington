Special Condition S8.D of the 2007-2012 Phase I Municipal Stormwater Permit required permittees to collect and analyze data to evaluate pollutant loadings of stormwater discharged from different land uses: high density (HD) residential, low density (LD) residential, commercial, and industrial.

To meet the S8.D requirement, Phase I Permittees collected water quality and flow data, sediment data, and toxicity information from stormwater discharges during storm events.
