Formal IT expenditure prioritization occurs on an annual basis as part of the state’s budget building activities (link is external). The Governor and the Legislature look to the OCIO to provide guidance on whether an agency's proposed IT expenditure is sound and consistent with the state’s IT strategy to inform policy decisions on the allocation of limited state funds.

The OCIO establishes prioritization criteria in response to current state business needs and changing technologies. The OCIO evaluates agency funding requests (received in the form of decision packages) against those values and establishes a priority ranking of all funding requests. The resulting prioritized list of project funding requests is submitted to both the Governor’s office and the Legislature.
