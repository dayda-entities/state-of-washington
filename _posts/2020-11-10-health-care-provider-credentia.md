Attention: The secretary of health extended health profession license expiration dates for licenses up for renewal between April 1 and September 30, 2020.  This extension allowed health professionals to focus on patient care and to promote continued patient safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also provided for a reduction in economic burden for those providers who could not work.  Health professional licenses that expired on September 30, 2020, and are in the renewal process, will be considered by the department as active until October 23, 2020.
Renewal processing delays may occur in October, due to a high volume of renewals being submitted at the end of September.  Users of Provider Credential Search and our Health Care Provider Credential Data on this site are cautioned about using the Last Issue and Expiration dates reflected until renewal processing can be completed.


The Washington State Department of Health presents this information as a service to the public. True and correct copies of legal disciplinary actions taken after July 1998 are available on our Provider Credential Search site. These records are considered certified by the Department of Health. 

This includes information on health care providers.

Please contact our Customer Service Center at 360-236-4700 for information about actions before July 1998. 
The information on this site comes directly from our database and is updated daily at 10:00 a.m.. This data is a primary source for verification of credentials and is extracted from the primary database at 2:00 a.m. daily.

News releases about disciplinary actions taken against Washington State healthcare providers, agencies or facilities are on the agency's Newsroom webpage.
