This dataset is a survey of outdoor recreation demand which includes responses from 3,114 residents of Washington state who were interviewed by phone between August 27 and October 26, 2012. The telephone survey was conducted using random digit dialing.  To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.  Study findings are representative at the statewide level as well as by planning region.  Any manipulation or analysis of the data should take this sampling approach and weighting into account.
