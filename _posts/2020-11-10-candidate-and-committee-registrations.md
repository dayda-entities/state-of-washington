This data set is an index of all PDC Candidate and Committee Registrations starting with 2006. Each record contains a link to view the actual document or a link on how to request the document.
The primary purpose of this dataset is for data consumers to examine the registrations of campaigns and committees. Refer to other dataset to get actual dollar values for any of the reports referenced herewith.
For Continuing committees and Surplus committees the committee id is the same year after year.
All other committees are single year committees and will have a new committee_id representing a new registration for a different election year.
