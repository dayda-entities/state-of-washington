Average percent of "pebble count" stations that are of sand or smaller size. Data are from Watershed Health Monitoring surveys conducted by the Department of Ecology during 2009-2019. Data from Recovery Regions are intended for the 2020 State of the Salmon Report. Reference the metric "PCT_SandFines" in the Watershed Health database. The reference category is based on Table 2 of Bryce et al (2010) J. N. Am. Benthol. Soc., 2010, 29(2):657â€“672 plus 5.5% for adjustment to bankfull channel rather than wetted.
