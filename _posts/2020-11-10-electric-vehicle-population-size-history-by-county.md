This shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks. 

DOL integrates National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel efficiency ratings with DOL titling and registration data to create this information.
