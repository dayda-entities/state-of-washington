Benthic Index of Biological Integrity (B-IBI) data (mean site score per survey) from Watershed Health Monitoring Surveys conducted by the Department of Ecology during 2009 through 2019. Data from Recovery Regions is intended for the 2020 State of the Salmon Report. B-IBI scores are accessible from Puget Sound Stream Benthos. See https://pugetsoundstreambenthos.org but this file uses a different rating method for "Good/Fair/Poor" that is based on percentiles of BIBI-scores from Department of Ecology reference sites during 2009-2018.
