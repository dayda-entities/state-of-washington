WA State Office of the Chief Information Officer Accessibility Policy #188 requires agencies and other groups required to follow OCIO Policy to identify an Accessibility Coordinator. Having a central list will help the public contact coordinators to resolve issues and assist Agencies with resources. http://ocio.wa.gov/policy/accessibility
