1.  This dataset provides summary data needed to help determine the premium for a flood insurance policy.

2.  The elevation and depth data come from approximate methods and could be one foot or more off. A FEMA Elevation Certificate is needed to provide the more accurate data required to write a policy. The dataset was compiled by French & Associates with support from the Washington State Department of Ecology. The source elevation information came from the Federal Emergency Management Agencyâ€™s Flood Depth Grid for Grays Harbor County. Property information came from Grays Harbor County, with help from the City of Aberdeen.
