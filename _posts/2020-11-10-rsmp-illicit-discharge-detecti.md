Most Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permittees in the State of Washington are a part of the Regional Stormwater Monitoring Program (RSMP).  One part of the RSMP is the Source Identification Information Repository.  Permittees may choose to enter their permit-required illicit discharge data into this dataset using a form, simplifying both their reporting processes and analyses for the RSMP.
