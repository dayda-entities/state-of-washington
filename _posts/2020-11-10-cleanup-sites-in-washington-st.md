This is a list of cleanup sites in Washington State. It includes sites and associated websites.  It includes location data, Cleanup Status, Site Rank – if the site is ranked, and if the site has an Environmental Covenant.  

Over half the cleanup sites have a status of “No Further Action Required/Decision” or NFA.  If a site has a NFA it includes the latest NFA date and NFA reason.  

The Washington Department of Ecology (Toxics Cleanup Program) works to clean up contaminated sites/properties throughout the state of Washington. This data was downloaded from the Integrated Site Information System (ISIS) database and is monthly.
